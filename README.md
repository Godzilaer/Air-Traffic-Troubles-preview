# Air-Traffic-Troubles
 
## What is this?
Air Traffic Troubles is a game I am developing both as a personal project and part of the Code Ninjas Black Belt program. It is a rendition of the job of an air traffic controller where you must direct planes to safely navigate and prevent collisions or significant delays. It focuses on the aspects of multitasking and strategy for sequencing aircraft.

## Will it be further updated?
I plan on continuing to work on the game and releasing it on a platform such as itch.io. Note that this public repository is a **basic preview version** of what will be the final product. Future versions will most likely not be pushed to this repository.

## How do I play?
The game is available both as a WebGL and .exe.
