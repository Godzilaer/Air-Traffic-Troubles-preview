# Air-Traffic-Troubles
 
## What is this?
Air Traffic Troubles is a small and relatively simple game I am developing both as a personal project and part of the Code Ninjas Black Belt program. It is a very simplistic rendition of the job of an air traffic controller where you must direct planes to safely navigate and prevent collisions or significant delays. It focuses on the aspects of multitasking and strategy for sequencing aircraft.
